      That's right, this month we're celebrating Broked Games (â„¢), because they
      matter too! This is the first time we're attempting to run this bonus and
      it's likely going to be the last time as well!
      <i>Let's be real here, I can't imagine this event being too popular.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept behind this event is to encourage participants to revisit
      games that have encountered one of two common problems, as identified by
      TA (TrueAchievements):
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
      <li>Server Closure</li>
      <li>
        Achievements listed as Unobtainable/Discontinued/Partially Discontinued
      </li>
    </ul>
    <i>Gasp, shock, awe!</i> But fear not, completionists! There will be
    numerous ways to participate and earn bonus points without having to
    confront the dreaded unobtainables directly.

    <p>
      The easiest (although least likely) way to participate would be to go back
      and mop up games that you may have already earned all of the discontinued
      (or grabbed all of the online achievements before the server shutdown!).
      If you don't have any of those on your tag - there are a number of games
      that have had online servers shut down, but do not have any online
      achievements - resulting in them still being able to be fully completed.
      Games like
      <a
        class="text-green-500 underline cursor-pointer hover:text-green-700"
        href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Army-of-Two-The-Devils-Cartel"
        >Army of Two</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Dead-Space-2"
        class="text-green-500 underline cursor-pointer hover:text-green-700"
        >Dead Space 2</a
      >, and
      <a
        class="text-green-500 underline cursor-pointer hover:text-green-700"
        href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/I-AM-Alive"
        >I Am Alive</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real kicker, and the main thought process behind this event, is that
      this month we're going to also
      <span class="underline"
        >allow games that are no longer able to be completed to count for bonus
        points</span
      >. So, if you've got a game that you've missed some achievements in before
      the servers went offline, or updates rendered them discontinued, you can
      now go back to the game and mop up the remaining achievements to earn
      bonus points.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a game to qualify - you will have to unlock all of your remaining
      "currently available" in it achievements during the month of April.
    </p>
    <aside class="bg-slate-900 p-5">
      It's important to note, however, that games with legitimate unobtainables
      will not count for this event. As these games have never had a legitimate
      completion - they have no time estimates for us to score off of. Often,
      the ratio is greatly skewed as accounts periodically register to TA with
      cheated achievements. <br /><br />It's also worth noting in advance that
      some games will not receive a "base BCMX" score, but will only receive
      bonus points. A game is only eligible for base points if you fully
      complete it. It's important to note, however, that games with legitimate

      community bonus points pool, though, which is detailed later on.

      <br /><br />
      Full Completion = Base BCMX Points + April Bonus Points (valid for any
      yearlies)><br />
      Partial Completion (all currently available achievements) = April Bonus
      Points
    </aside>
    <p>
      As with previous months - bonus points are going to be awarded as a
      multiplier of the games base BCMX value. This multiplier will be the same
      across the board for any game that qualifies for the bonus. The multiplier
      will be +80% of a game's BCMX score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="underline font-bold"
        >There will, however, be a cap to the bonus points available for each
        user this month.</span
      >
      A cap of 3,000 bonus points will be available - if this threshold is
      reached no more bonus will be earned for the duration of the month. This
      was done as a precaution due to this bonus being an extremely experimental
      bonus.
    </p>
    <aside class="bg-slate-900 p-5">
      <b>Important Rule</b>: For any completion to count towards this bonus the
      ratio must be at or above 1.5 and have a time estimate at or above 5-6
      hours. Or the time estimate must be at or above 20 hours regardless of
      ratio. There is no ruling against stacks. Any game released in April of
      2024 will not qualify for this bonus. Additionally, any completion that is
      due to a new DLC or TU releasing in April of 2024 also will not qualify
      for this bonus.
    </aside>
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">But wait, there's more!</h2>
    <p>
      Continuing with the trends from previous months - we'll be offering a
      Community Bonus to strive for inside of this bonus!
    </p>
    <aside class="bg-slate-900 p-5">
      We're going to switch things up this month. And instead of offering a
      blanket bonus worth X points - we're going to challenge you lovely gamers
      to build the bonus points pool up. For each game that is played that
      qualifies for the above bonus, 5 points will be added to a pool. The pool
      will max out at 1,000 bonus points. Each instance of a game counts - so if
      three people played Mirror's Edge, it would equate 15 points rather than
      5.
      <br /><br />As an additional method to add points into this total - any
      game with legitimate unobtainables played throughout the event will add 25
      points to the pool. For it to be picked up an achievement will need to be
      tracked during April
