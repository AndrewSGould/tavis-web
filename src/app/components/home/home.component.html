  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Welcome, fellow Achievement Hunters!</h3>
  <p>
    Our website is still under construction, just like that secret room in your
    favorite RPG that you're convinced holds the ultimate loot.
    <br /><br />But, while we're building this place, join our merry band of
    achievement aficionados in the Discord and stay tuned for leaderboards,
    stats, and more badges than a scout's sash... <br /><br />Until then, keep
    gaming, keep conquering, and keep chasing those achievements like they owe
    you money! <br /><br />Cheers, The BCMX Team (Work-in-Progress Edition*)
