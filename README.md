#### UHH Matchup Ideas

~~Overall goal is to generate a list of 'compatability' for every player.~~
~~Player 1 has a xx% compatability with Player 2, a xx% compatability with Player 3, etc~~

~~- If a game is in both collections, add a point~~
~~- After adding points for every matchup, find the highest~~

#### Design Notes

- TA ID should be primary key for Player table?
- Write Integration tests that ping TA to ensure scraping is working (run monthly?)
- Diagnostics table that tracks processing time
  - Include 'Last Updated' field
- Change Api to versioning approach (v1/profile/.., v1/collection/.., v1/game/.., v1/period/.., v1/scraper/..)
- What other games to parse? Period Summary? Game pages?
- Thread and throttle TA hits to prevent unintentional DoS (Akka? ProtoActor?)
  - What time frame can I spread this out to while still being quick? 4hrs? Ideally sooner
- In the Player table (or separate table?) track what contests the player is in
- Try scraping Period Summary - https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/{gamertag}/periods/2022/05
- Ability to schedule syncs

#### Roles

- Super Admin (god user)
- Admin (user who can do larger TA syncs)
- BcmAdmin, RaidBossAdmin (administrative duties per contest)
- Member

### Sync Manager

- Show how many Players will be sync'd
- Estimate how long the Sync will take (estimated)
  - Calculate this based off of Sync history. Average of sync time / average of players synced
